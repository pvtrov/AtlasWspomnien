# Current Status

## Project State

The project has completed Sprint 1 foundation work and has started Sprint 2 user-domain groundwork.

The repository structure has been created, the core technology stack has been selected, Git workflow has been established, and Docker has been adopted as the primary local development environment.

The repository now includes:

- a working FastAPI scaffold,
- a working Next.js scaffold,
- PostgreSQL database foundation and migration scaffolding,
- an initial persisted user domain model with role representation,
- a backend health endpoint,
- a frontend status page with backend connectivity check,
- project and sprint documentation aligned with Sprint 1 and current Sprint 2 scope.

The current repository state is ready to continue Sprint 2 authentication-focused work on top of the implemented user foundation.

## Current Repository Structure

The repository currently contains the main areas agreed for the project:

- `backend/` for the Python API and backend logic,
- `frontend/` for the web application,
- `documentation/` for project-facing knowledge and decisions,
- `infra/` for infrastructure-related files,
- `scripts/` for helper scripts,
- `tests/` for top-level cross-system tests,
- `Requirements/` for source requirements and original project input.

## Implemented Foundation So Far

The repository now includes the first Sprint 1 application scaffolding work:

### Backend

- FastAPI foundation with application entry point, central routing, versioned API routing, configuration, and a health-check endpoint,
- environment-loading structure for local and Docker-based development,
- a backend CORS configuration path driven by environment settings for local frontend access,
- a basic backend smoke test for the health endpoint and CORS coverage for the frontend origin.

### Database

- SQLAlchemy base, engine, and session scaffolding,
- Alembic configuration wired to the backend environment settings,
- an initial empty migration baseline ready for future schema changes,
- a user persistence migration that creates the initial `users` table,
- database connectivity driven through `DATABASE_URL`.

### User Domain

- an initial persisted `User` model,
- explicit stored roles for `creator` and `administrator`,
- an implicit public `viewer` role for non-authenticated archive access,
- a unique `username` field as the initial nick or handle representation,
- a user blocking flag to support later MVP moderation flow,
- foundational backend user schemas prepared for later registration and login work.

### Frontend

- Next.js application foundation with root layout and a simple status page,
- shared frontend styling foundation through global styles and design tokens,
- a minimal layout component and shared frontend API base URL resolution,
- a browser-side connectivity check from frontend to backend health endpoint,
- a simple UI status flow for checking, success, and failure states.

### Local Development

- Docker-based local structure for backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL services.

## Working Rules

- Before making changes in the codebase, propose the idea step by step and wait for user approval before implementation.
- Keep project knowledge in `documentation/` so future threads can continue work from repository state instead of chat history alone.
- Local helper files such as `AI-NOTES.md` and `AGENTS.md` may be used if needed, but they should remain local-only and must not be pushed to the remote repository.
- Use Git and GitHub as the project version control workflow.
- Functional tests should be added at the end when requested by the user, or explicitly proposed once functional code is ready.

## Next Recommended Step

The next recommended implementation step is to continue Sprint 2 by building authentication on top of the implemented user model.

The most natural next product and implementation area is:

- authentication and authorization foundation,
- creator registration and login,
- password hashing and credential verification,
- protected backend routes,
- initial auth-related frontend flows.
