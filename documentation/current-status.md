# Current Status

## Project State

The project is at the end of Sprint 1 foundation work.

The repository structure has been created, the core technology stack has been selected, Git workflow has been established, and Docker has been adopted as the primary local development environment.

The repository now includes:

- a working FastAPI scaffold,
- a working Next.js scaffold,
- PostgreSQL database foundation and migration scaffolding,
- a backend health endpoint,
- a frontend status page with backend connectivity check,
- project and sprint documentation aligned with Sprint 1 scope.

The current repository state is ready to move from foundation work into the next implementation stage.

## Confirmed Decisions

- Git branching strategy: see [git-workflow.md](/Users/apatro/Repos/priv/PW/AITSI/documentation/git-workflow.md)
- Local development setup and Docker usage: see [setup.md](/Users/apatro/Repos/priv/PW/AITSI/documentation/setup.md)
- MVP scope: see [mvp.md](/Users/apatro/Repos/priv/PW/AITSI/documentation/product/mvp.md)
- User stories: see [user-stories.md](/Users/apatro/Repos/priv/PW/AITSI/documentation/product/user-stories.md)
- Epics and implementation tasks: see [epics-and-tasks.md](/Users/apatro/Repos/priv/PW/AITSI/documentation/product/epics-and-tasks.md)
- Current implementation scope for Sprint 1: see [sprint-1.md](/Users/apatro/Repos/priv/PW/AITSI/documentation/sprints/sprint-1.md)

## Current Repository Structure

The repository currently contains the main areas agreed for the project:

- `backend/` for the Python API and backend logic,
- `frontend/` for the web application,
- `documentation/` for project-facing knowledge and decisions,
- `infra/` for infrastructure-related files,
- `scripts/` for helper scripts,
- `tests/` for top-level cross-system tests,
- `Requirements/` for source requirements and original project input.

## Implemented Foundation So Far

The repository now includes the first Sprint 1 application scaffolding work:

### Backend

- FastAPI foundation with application entry point, central routing, versioned API routing, configuration, and a health-check endpoint,
- environment-loading structure for local and Docker-based development,
- a backend CORS configuration path driven by environment settings for local frontend access,
- a basic backend smoke test for the health endpoint and CORS coverage for the frontend origin.

### Database

- SQLAlchemy base, engine, and session scaffolding,
- Alembic configuration wired to the backend environment settings,
- an initial empty migration baseline ready for future schema changes,
- database connectivity driven through `DATABASE_URL`.

### Frontend

- Next.js application foundation with root layout and a simple status page,
- shared frontend styling foundation through global styles and design tokens,
- a minimal layout component and shared frontend API base URL resolution,
- a browser-side connectivity check from frontend to backend health endpoint,
- a simple UI status flow for checking, success, and failure states.

### Local Development

- Docker-based local structure for backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL services.

## Working Rules

- Before making changes in the codebase, propose the idea step by step and wait for user approval before implementation.
- Keep project knowledge in `documentation/` so future threads can continue work from repository state instead of chat history alone.
- Local helper files such as `AI-NOTES.md` and `AGENTS.md` may be used if needed, but they should remain local-only and must not be pushed to the remote repository.
- Use Git and GitHub as the project version control workflow.
- Functional tests should be added at the end when requested by the user, or explicitly proposed once functional code is ready.

## Next Recommended Step

The next recommended implementation step is to define and begin Sprint 2.

The most natural next product and implementation area is:

- users and authentication,
- user model and roles,
- creator registration and login,
- protected backend routes,
- initial frontend authentication views.
